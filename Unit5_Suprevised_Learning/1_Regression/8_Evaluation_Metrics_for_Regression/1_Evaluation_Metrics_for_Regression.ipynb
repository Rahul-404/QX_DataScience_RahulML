It is simply the average of the squared difference between the target value and the value predicted by the regression model. As it squares the differences, it penalizes even a small error which leads to over-estimation of how bad the model is. It is preferred more than other metrics because it is differentiable and hence can be optimized better."

It is not suitable for applications where you want to pay more attention to the outliers."

The metric helps us to compare our current model with a constant baseline and tells us how much our model is better. The constant baseline is chosen by taking the mean of the data and drawing a line at the mean. RÂ² is a scale-free score that implies it doesn't matter whether the values are too large or too small, the RÂ² will always be less than or equal to 1.\n"

    "    <li>Sometimes while coding the regression algorithm, the researcher might forget to add the intercept to the regressor which will also lead to RÂ² being negative. This is because, without the benefit of an intercept, the regression could do worse than the sample mean(baseline) in terms of tracking the dependent variable (i.e., the numerator could be greater than the denominator). However, most of the standard machine learning library like scikit-learn include the intercept by default but if you are using stats-model library then you have to add the intercept manually.</li>\n",
